/*
The following code illustrates how to use closures to define public functions that can access private functions and variables.

The shared lexical environment is created in the body of an anonymous function, which is executed as soon as it has been defined (also known as an IIFE). The lexical environment contains two private items: a variable called privateCounter, and a function called changeBy. You can't access either of these private members from outside the anonymous function. Instead, you can access them using the three public functions that are returned from the anonymous wrapper.

const counter = (function () {
    let privateCounter = 0;
    function changeBy(val) {
      privateCounter += val;
    }
  
    return {
      increment() {
        changeBy(1);
      },
  
      decrement() {
        changeBy(-1);
      },
  
      value() {
        return privateCounter;
      },
    };
  })();
  
  console.log(counter.value()); // 0.
  
  counter.increment();
  counter.increment();
  console.log(counter.value()); // 2.
  
  counter.decrement();
  console.log(counter.value()); // 1.
